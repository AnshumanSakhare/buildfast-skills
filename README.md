Most "agent skills" you find online are one paragraph of advice in a markdown file. Some of these are more than that.

**Eleven of them are more than a single file** — reference docs the agent reads before it acts, and in six cases executable scripts it actually runs. Three ship worked example output you can open in a browser right now. Point Claude Code at `launch-audit-skill` and you get a real launch-readiness report with a verdict, not a bulleted opinion. Point it at `html-game-generator-skill` and you get a finished game in one HTML file, with menus and sound and save support.

**The other twenty-one are tight, opinionated playbooks** — one focused `SKILL.md` that gives the agent a real point of view on one job, from neo-brutalist art direction to Mongoose index strategy. Small on disk, and the ones you'll reach for daily.

Every skill carries a badge saying which kind it is, so you always know what you're installing. All of them work in whatever agent you already use, and all of them install in about four seconds.

<br>

## Quickstart

Every skill installs with the open [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI — one command, nothing to clone:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/buildfastwithai/agent-skills/tree/main/startup-skills/launch-audit-skill
```

Swap the trailing path for any skill in [the catalog](#the-catalog) below. Or take the whole registry at once and pick interactively:

```bash
npx skills add buildfastwithai/agent-skills
```

Then restart your agent and just talk to it:

> *"Audit https://myproduct.com before launch."*

No config file. No API key. No account.

<br>

<br>

## Use it in any agent

These are plain [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) folders — a `SKILL.md` plus whatever it needs. Anything that reads that format can use them: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, opencode.

The `skills` CLI detects what you have installed and puts the folder in the right place. If you'd rather not use it, copy the folder by hand — `git clone` this repo and drop `<category>-skills/<name>-skill` into your agent's skills directory. That's the whole install.

Using **Cowork**? Skills are account-level rather than on disk — install locally first, then upload the skill folder in the Cowork UI.

<br>

## What's actually in a skill

A skill is a folder your agent reads *on demand*. It stays out of the context window until the description matches what you asked for, then the agent pulls in exactly the parts it needs.

```text
launch-audit-skill/
├── SKILL.md              ← the entry point: when to trigger, how to work
├── README.md             ← human-facing docs
├── references/           ← deep context the agent reads before acting
│   ├── evaluation-framework.md
│   └── report-schema.md
├── scripts/              ← real code the agent executes
│   └── generate_report.mjs
├── templates/            ← output scaffolding
├── agents/               ← an openai.yaml for Codex
└── examples/             ← a finished report you can open right now
```

`SKILL.md` opens with frontmatter that decides when the skill fires:

```yaml
---
name: launch-audit-skill
description: Audit a startup, SaaS, app, developer tool, landing page, or
  product before launch from a live URL, localhost page, repository,
  screenshots, or supplied copy. Use when the user needs to test whether a
  public experience is launch-ready, produce a Ready to launch / Launch after
  critical fixes / Not ready yet verdict, or create a standalone HTML report.
---
```

That `description` is the trigger. It's the only part always in context, which is why every skill here spends real effort on it.

The format is Anthropic's [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) spec — the same one Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and opencode all read. Write once, run everywhere.

<br>

## Repo structure

```text
agent-skills/
├── README.md                 this file — the catalog
├── app-builder-skills/   6   finished, runnable products
├── ui-skills/            8   design systems and art direction
├── startup-skills/       3   GTM, launch readiness, financials
├── backend-skills/       4   APIs, schemas, auth
├── docs-skills/          3   READMEs and research synthesis
└── workflow-skills/      8   agent tooling and process
```

32 skills across six category folders, each sitting at the root of the repo — so a skill's path is just `<category>-skills/<name>-skill`.

That's the whole repo. No build step, no manifest, no installer to maintain — each skill folder is self-describing, and the `skills` CLI reads them directly off GitHub.

<br>

## Contributing

New skills are welcome — especially ones that *do* something rather than describe something.

The bar: a real `SKILL.md` whose `description` earns its trigger, and at least one worked example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildfastwithai/agent-skills
cd agent-skills
mkdir -p <category>-skills/my-thing-skill   # note the -skill suffix
# write SKILL.md, add a row to the catalog table, open a PR
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to install npm packages or an API key?</b></summary>
<br>
No. <code>npx skills</code> just copies folders into your agent's skills directory. Nothing phones home, nothing needs a key, nothing runs in the background.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will these work outside Claude Code?</b></summary>
<br>
Yes. They follow the open Agent Skills <code>SKILL.md</code> format, which Codex, Cursor and opencode also read. A few skills bundle an <code>agents/openai.yaml</code> for Codex specifically. For anything else, copy the folder in by hand.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does the agent know when to use a skill?</b></summary>
<br>
Off the <code>description</code> in the frontmatter — that one line is the only part loaded into context up front. You can also name a skill directly: <i>"use landing-page-generator-skill for this."</i>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I update?</b></summary>
<br>
Run the same <code>add</code> command again — it overwrites in place, so re-running is how you upgrade.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I install more than one at a time?</b></summary>
<br>
Yes — <code>npx skills add buildfastwithai/agent-skills</code> pulls the whole registry and lets you pick from a list.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where do the outputs go?</b></summary>
<br>
Into your working directory, usually an <code>outputs/</code> folder, with clickable local links. Skills that generate reports also emit the structured JSON behind them so you can re-render or edit.
