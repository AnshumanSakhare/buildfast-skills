<h1 align="center">🧪 Test Strength</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>Coverage lies. Mutation testing tells you whether your tests would notice a bug.</strong></p>

> Measures whether a pytest suite actually detects behaviour changes, using diff-scoped mutation testing. Audits suite strength, evaluates whether tests cover changed code, investigates surviving mutants, and proposes plus verifies targeted tests for what was missed.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/buildfastwithai/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/workflow-skills/test-strength-skill
```

<sub>Installs into every agent that reads the <code>SKILL.md</code> format. Add <code>--global</code> to install for all projects, or run <code>npx skills add</code> with no argument to pick interactively.</sub>

## What it does

- Mutates changed code and checks whether your tests notice
- Scopes to the diff so runs stay fast on real repos
- Copies the tree to a temp dir — your working tree is never touched
- Reports surviving mutants with the exact behaviour that went undetected
- Proposes targeted tests, then verifies they kill the mutant
- Ships strong/weak fixture suites so you can see the difference

## Try it

Once installed, just talk to your agent in plain language:

> *"Audit the strength of my pytest suite."*

> *"Do my tests actually cover the code I changed in this branch?"*

> *"Find surviving mutants and write tests that kill them."*

## What you get back

- ✅ &nbsp;**Mutation report**
- ✅ &nbsp;**Surviving-mutant analysis**
- ✅ &nbsp;**Proposed + verified tests**
